# Exolink link directory
Exolink lets you make Exoracer share links with custom titles, descriptions, and images.

Google has [announced](https://firebase.google.com/support/dynamic-links-faq) that Firebase Dynamic Links, the service that powers Exoracer's built-in level sharing links as well as Exolink's custom links, will be shutdown on August 25th, 2025.

> On August 25th, 2025, Firebase Dynamic Links will shut down. All links served by Firebase Dynamic Links (both hosted on custom domains and page.link subdomains) will stop working and you will no longer be able to create new links.

This link directory aims to preserve as many `exoracer.page.link` and `exo.page.link` links as possible. So far, the ability to use new Exolink links is entirely dependent on a version increase. This is fine, but presents a few problems:
* I'm less likely to add new links as quickly: I almost feel obligated to have to add something else to make the new version "worth it".
* It adds unnecessary disk space for those who don't want it. (This is over ~5,500 files as of writing!)

An external link directory repository allows for the independent adding and updating of new links while lessening these issues.
